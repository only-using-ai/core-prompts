## Notes and Decisions
- Project appears to be a collection of role-based instruction files for product development teams
- Usage involves mentioning the product-development-team.md file and having it coordinate implementation
- Need to document how to use this system effectively

## Ideas to Consider
- Include usage examples
- Document the workflow process
- Explain the purpose of each role file
- Provide setup/installation instructions if needed
